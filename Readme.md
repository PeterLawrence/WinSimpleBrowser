WinSimpleBrowser - v0.0.1 Alpha (Freeware/Openware)
--

WinSimpleBrowser is a very small and light weight text based internet browser for Windows 2000, XP, 2003 and Vista.

WinSimpleBrowser includes the ability to save all images in the currently displayed webpage to a specified folder.

This application in itself is of little use except for demonstrating some low level C++ code for a client TCP application in conjunction with simple multithreading.
